    <H1>About Me</H1> 
 If you can't find me at my computer, you'll probably catch me hitting the gym, pushing myself to reach my fitness goals, or simply enjoying quality time with my husband and adorable daughter. Striking that perfect balance between my creative work and family life is what keeps me going and motivates me to give my best in everything I do.

 Why UX Designer/ Developer?
</H2>
<section>
    Transitioning from a six-year career as an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) in the Air Force, I noticed a critical issue in software systems used during emergencies: their lack of user-friendliness. This challenge often made crucial operations difficult and frustrating.

    Motivated by this firsthand experience, I redirected my career path toward UX Design and Development. My goal is to leverage my background in emergency response to create intuitive and user-centric interfaces. This shift allows me to combine my operational insights with design skills, ensuring that technology supports, rather than hinders, critical tasks in high-pressure environments.
    
    I am passionate about enhancing software usability, especially in critical scenarios, aiming to deliver seamless experiences that empower users on the front lines.
